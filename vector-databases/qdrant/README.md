# Qdrant

[Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) is an AI-native vector database and semantic search engine designed to
extract meaningful insights from unstructured data.

With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!

Qdrant also provides great [documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/), starting with a High-Level Overview of Qdrant's Architecture.

## Deployment procedure

1. **Clone** or navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc.git).

    To get started, clone the repository using:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc.git
    cd llm-on-nerc/vector-databases/qdrant
    ```

2. In the `standalone` folder, you will find the following YAML files that allow you to easily deploy a **Qdrant** instance:

    -   **01-qdrant-secret.yaml**: Defines the **Secret** for storing sensitive data, such as credentials or API keys, used by Qdrant. Change **QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY** value with your own!

    -   **02-qdrant-pvc.yaml**: Defines an additional **PVC** for storing data, ensuring that Qdrant's data persists across restarts. Adjust the size according to your needs.

    -   **03-qdrant-persistent-pvc.yaml**: Creates a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** for persistent storage to store Qdrant's data as a managed Qdrant snapshot. Adjust the size according to your needs.

    -   **04-qdrant-deployment.yaml**: Deploys the **Qdrant container** as a stateless application within your OpenShift cluster.

    -   **05-qdrant-service.yaml**: Exposes the **Qdrant deployment** as a **Service** to allow communication between Qdrant and other services in the cluster.

    -   **06-qdrant-route.yaml**: Configures a **Route** to expose the Qdrant service to external traffic, enabling web access.

You can run this `oc` command: `oc apply -f ./standalone/.` to execute all of the above described YAML files located in the **standalone** folder at once.

```sh
oc apply -f ./standalone/.

secret/qdrant-key created
persistentvolumeclaim/qdrant-storage-pvc created
persistentvolumeclaim/qdrant-snapshots-pvc created
deployment.apps/qdrant-deployment created
service/qdrant-service created
route.route.openshift.io/qdrant-route created
```

To delete all resources if not necessary just run `oc delete -f ./standalone/.` or `oc delete all,pvc,secret -l app=qdrant`.

## Usage

The API is now accessible at the endpoints:

-   defined by your Service, accessible internally on port **6333** using http. E.g. `http://qdrant-service.<your-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:6333`.

-   defined by your Route, accessible externally through https, e.g. `https://qdrant-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.

**Accessing Qdrant Dashboard:**

Go to [`https://qdrant-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org/dashboard`](https://qdrant-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org/dashboard). This will prompt you for an **API key** that has been set up as a secret using the `01-qdrant-secret.yaml`.

To get the value of `QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY` from the `qdrant-key` Secret using the `oc` command, follow these steps:

`oc get secret qdrant-key -o jsonpath='{.data.QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY}' | base64 --decode`

This command does the following:

-   Fetches the `qdrant-key` secret.

-   Extracts the `QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY` field from the secret's data.

-   Decodes the `base64-encoded` value to get the original *API key*.
