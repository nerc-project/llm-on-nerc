# Milvus

[Milvus](https://milvus.io/) is Vector database built for scalable similarity search. It is "Open-source, highly scalable, and blazing fast".

As Milvus supports meany features, the easiest way to understand what it can do is to head to the relevant [documentation](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md).

Milvus also provides great documentation, starting with a full description of its architecture.

## A Standalone Deployment

The following recipes will deploy a default installation of Milvus in standalone mode, with authentication enabled. Here, we will also deploy [Attu](https://github.com/zilliztech/attu), that provides an interactive management UI for Milvus.

However, many things can be modified in this configuration, through the provided `standalone/config/openshift-values.yaml` file.

-   The default Milvus deployment leverages Minio to store logs and index files. This can be replaced by another S3 storage system.

    To modify those components, as well many other configuration parameters, please refer to the [configuration documentation](https://milvus.io/docs/deploy_s3.md) and modify the values file according to your needs.

### Deployment procedure

1. **Clone** or navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc.git).

    To get started, clone the repository using:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nerc-project/llm-on-nerc.git
    cd llm-on-nerc/vector-databases/milvus
    ```

2. In the `standalone` folder, you will find the following YAML files:

    -   **attu-deployment.yaml**: Deploys **Attu**, the web-based UI for managing and visualizing Milvus vector database operations.

    -   **etcd-resources.yaml**: Defines the **etcd** resources, which provide a distributed key-value store for Milvus metadata management.

    -   **milvus-config.yaml**: Contains the **configuration settings** for Milvus, specifying parameters like storage, indexing, and query performance.
    This includes `milvus.yaml` key to set different configurations, you need to update them as required.

    -   **milvus-resources.yaml**: Defines the **Milvus deployment** and related Kubernetes resources necessary to run the vector database.

    -   **minio-resources.yaml**: Deploys **MinIO**, an object storage service used by Milvus to store and manage vector data.

    **NOTE:** **Etcd** is a distributed key-value store that provides a reliable solution for storing and managing configuration data, service discovery, and remote procedure calls (RPCs) in distributed systems. It is widely used in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesos to manage system configuration and state.

    Milvus can be deployed on the NERC OpenShift in Standalone mode. You can run this `oc` command: `oc apply -f ./standalone/.` to execute all of the above described YAML files located in the **standalone** folder at once.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f ./standalone/.

    deployment.apps/attu-deployment created
    service/attu-service created
    route.route.openshift.io/attu-route created
    persistentvolumeclaim/etcd-pvc created
    deployment.apps/etcd-deployment created
    service/etcd-service created
    configmap/milvus-config created
    persistentvolumeclaim/milvus-pvc created
    deployment.apps/milvus-deployment created
    service/milvus-service created
    route.route.openshift.io/milvus-route created
    persistentvolumeclaim/minio-pvc created
    deployment.apps/minio-deployment created
    service/minio-service created
    route.route.openshift.io/minio-console created
    ```

    **Authentication:**

    Milvus has now been deployed with `authentication` enabled, which is configured as `milvus-config` ConfigMap through the `milvus-config.yaml` file. This is because, the `milvus.yaml` key is set with the following configuration:

    ```sh
    ...
    security:
        authorizationEnabled: true
    ...
    ```

This enables authentication in Milvus. The default admin user is `root` with the default password `Milvus`.

To delete all resources if not necessary just run `oc delete -f ./standalone/.` or `oc delete all,pvc,configmap -l app=milvus`.

## Usage

The API is now accessible at the endpoints:

-   defined by your Service, accessible internally on port **11434** using http.

    This is accessible **within the cluster only**, such as from the NERC RHOAI Workbench hosted Jupyter Notebooks or another pod within your project namespace.

    You can use either the service name or the fully qualified internal Hostname for service routing, as shown below:

    -   **Option 1:** Using the service name i.e. http://ollama-service:11434

    -   **Option 2:** Using the full internal hostname i.e. http://ollama-service.<your-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:11434

-   defined by your Route, accessible externally through https, e.g. `https://ollama-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.

-   defined by your Attu Route, accessible externally through https, e.g. `https://attu-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.

**Access deployed Attu web-based UI for Milvus:**

To access the deployed Attu web-based UI for Milvus, follow these steps:

**Find the Route URL:** The URL to access the Attu web UI should be in the following format: `https://attu-route-<your-namespace>.apps.shift.nerc.mghpcc.org`.

**NOTE:** Replace <your-namespace> with the appropriate namespace where your deployment is run.

**Access the Attu:** Open a web browser and navigate to the route URL to access the Attu web-based UI for Milvus.

Since, Milvus has been deployed with `authorizationEnabled: true` security setting in `milvus.yaml` key of the `milvus-config` ConfigMap:

To login the Attu web UI, please make sure to connect to:

-   **Milvus Server:** milvus-service:19530

-   **Milvus Database:** default

-   Toggle on: "Authentication"

-   **Token:** Empty

-   **username:** root

-   **password:** Milvus

**NOTE:** The default admin user is `root` with the default password `Milvus`.
